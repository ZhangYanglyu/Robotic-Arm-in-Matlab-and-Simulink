# Robotic-Arm-in-Matlab-and-Simulink
4, 5 and 6 DOF robotic arm simscape model as well as Matlab code for calculations.
# How to operate.

step1. Put all the folder where Matlab can reach.\
Step2. Go to the <name>_basic_analysis.m file run the whole file.\
Step3. Make sure the timeseries function work perfectly (it is important for Simulink part).\
Step4. Open the .slx file and run it. (After timeseries function exection in the last).\
Step5. Press Run for simulation.\
ENJOY\

we can change the initial and final points in the .m files under workspace of ROBOT.\
